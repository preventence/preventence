# 7 Types of Maintenance: A Complete Guide to Asset Reliability (2026)

Maintenance plays a critical role in ensuring the reliability, safety, and efficiency of equipment, systems, and facilities. In modern industry, "maintenance" is no longer a one-size-fits-all term. Choosing the right strategy for each asset can significantly reduce downtime, extend asset life, and lower operational costs.

At **Preventence**, we provide the digital infrastructure needed to manage every layer of maintenance—from simple routine checks to complex predictive data analysis.

This guide explores the seven main types of maintenance, their purposes, and how to apply them effectively within your organization.

## The Maintenance Maturity Spectrum

Not all maintenance is created equal. Most organizations use a mix of these strategies depending on how critical the asset is to their daily operations.



### **1. Reactive Maintenance (Breakdown Maintenance)**
Reactive maintenance follows a **"run-to-failure"** approach. Action is only taken once the equipment has already failed.
* **Key Characteristics:** Unplanned, high-pressure, and often involves emergency repair costs.
* **Best Used For:** Non-critical assets where failure has minimal impact on safety or production (e.g., office lighting).
* **The Risk:** Can lead to unexpected production halts and secondary damage to surrounding parts.

### **2. Preventive Maintenance (PM)**
Preventive maintenance involves **scheduled** inspections and servicing to prevent failures before they occur.
* **Key Characteristics:** Time-based or usage-based (e.g., every 3 months or every 1,000 hours).
* **Best Used For:** Critical assets with predictable wear patterns, such as HVAC systems or motors.
* **The Preventence Edge:** Automate your PM schedules so no service window is ever forgotten.
<!-- --- -->

### **3. Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**
Predictive maintenance uses **real-time data and sensors** to predict exactly when a failure will occur.
* **Key Characteristics:** Condition-based; uses technologies like thermal imaging, vibration analysis, and IoT sensors.
* **Best Used For:** High-value, complex machinery where downtime costs are extreme.
* **The Benefit:** Maintenance is performed "just-in-time," ensuring you get the maximum life out of every component.
<!-- --- -->

### **4. Corrective Maintenance**
Corrective maintenance is the act of repairing or restoring equipment after a fault is identified during a different task, but **before** a total failure happens.
* **Example:** A technician performing a routine PM notices a small leak and schedules a repair for the next day.
* **Key Characteristics:** Planned but fault-driven; less urgent than reactive maintenance.
<!-- --- -->

### **5. Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)**
CBM is triggered by the **actual condition** of the equipment rather than a calendar date.
* **How it works:** Sensors monitor specific parameters (e.g., pressure or temperature). Maintenance is only triggered when these readings exceed safe thresholds.
* **Difference from PdM:** CBM reacts to current "red flags," while PdM uses data trends to forecast future failures.
<!-- --- -->

### **6. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM)**
RCM is a high-level strategic approach. It involves analyzing every possible failure mode of an asset to determine the most cost-effective maintenance type for each specific part.
* **Best Used For:** Highly regulated industries like aviation or power plants where safety and compliance are the top priorities.
<!-- --- -->

### **7. Proactive Maintenance**
Unlike other types that fix symptoms, Proactive Maintenance focuses on **eliminating the root cause** of failure.
* **Approach:** Utilizing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to determine why a part failed and changing the environment or process to ensure it never happens again.

## Maintenance Strategy Comparison



| Strategy | Cost | Complexity | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reactive** | Low (Initial) | Low | Non-critical equipment |
| **Preventive** | Medium | Medium | Critical/Routine assets |
| **Predictive** | High (Initial) | High | Complex/High-value assets |
| **Proactive** | Medium | High | Recurring problem areas |
